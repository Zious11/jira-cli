# Burst Log — cycle-001

## Burst 1 (2026-05-04)

**Agents dispatched:** devops-engineer, state-manager
**Files touched:** .factory/STATE.md, .factory/cycles/cycle-001/cycle-manifest.md, .factory/cycles/cycle-001/burst-log.md
**Versions bumped:** (none)

### Summary

Factory infrastructure bootstrapped by devops-engineer: factory-artifacts branch created, .factory/ worktree mounted, placeholder STATE.md written. State-manager seeded STATE.md with full brownfield activation state at v0.5.0-dev.7 (activation HEAD dea166471e22eff55974d7675593469b37048c5f, factory-artifacts seed SHA b8f66501d12a37f7669e01cc95cdb24029a1b4b2). Cycle-001 directory initialized. Env preflight running in parallel via dx-engineer.

## Burst 2 (2026-05-04)

**Agents dispatched:** codebase-analyzer ×7, state-manager
**Files touched:** semport/jira-cli/ (7 pass artifacts), .factory/.gitignore, .factory/STATE.md, .factory/cycles/cycle-001/burst-log.md
**Versions bumped:** (none)

### Summary

Phase A brownfield ingest of jira-cli complete. codebase-analyzer ran 7 broad passes (inventory → architecture → domain model → behavioral contracts → NFR catalog → conventions → synthesis). All 7 pass files committed to factory-artifacts (SHA 0380885). logs/ untracked via .gitignore. DEC-002 added: default pre-VSDD docs treatment is HARMONIZE per Pass 6 §7.5 — pending human approval at Phase 0 → Phase 1 gate.

## Burst 3 (2026-05-04)

**Agents dispatched:** codebase-analyzer ×20 rounds across 6 passes, state-manager
**Files touched:** semport/jira-cli/ (21 deep-round files), .factory/STATE.md, .factory/cycles/cycle-001/burst-log.md
**Versions bumped:** (none)

### Summary

Phase B convergence deepening complete. All 6 passes converged to NITPICK via iterative deepening. codebase-analyzer ran 20 total rounds (Pass 0: R1-R2, Pass 1: R1-R2, Pass 2: R1-R7, Pass 3: R1-R4, Pass 4: R1-R4, Pass 5: R1-R2). 21 deep-round artifacts committed to factory-artifacts (SHA 257bdd7). 5 cross-pollination bugs verified at source. 12+ hallucinations caught and retracted (CONV-ABS markers). DEC-003 added: address 4 MUST-FIX bugs at Phase 0→1 gate. Phase B.5 coverage audit is next.

Key findings cataloged:
- 540 BCs total (475 HIGH / 59 MEDIUM / 6 LOW), 47 holdout scenarios
- 411 domain invariants, 265 domain entities
- 44 NFR gaps (1 CRITICAL / 4 HIGH / 16 MEDIUM / 22 LOW)
- 7 architectural patterns + 7 anti-patterns identified
- 4 MUST-FIX correctness bugs: handle_open OAuth, list_worklogs truncation, hardcoded 8h/5d, multi-workspace HashMap
- CRITICAL multi-profile fields silent regression (12 read sites)
- 2 security gaps: JR_AUTH_HEADER no production gating, --verbose header dump

**Versions bumped:** (none)

### Summary

Phase B.5 coverage audit: PASS — no implementation-surface blind spots. 2 MEDIUM optional doc-surface items flagged (README + install.sh), non-blocking.

Phase B.6 extraction validation: PASS — 96.7% behavioral accuracy (29/30 confirmed, 1 inaccurate, 0 hallucinated). 0 phantom modules / dependencies / BCs. 2 minor metric annotation deltas (off-by-one NFR count summary; mermaid count annotation).

Phase C final synthesis: complete — 750 lines. Lessons section: P0=4, P1=8, P2=6, P3=5. Downstream skill recommendations: /create-brief, /create-domain-spec (READY), /create-prd, /decompose-stories (~22 stories / 3 waves), /create-architecture. Pre-VSDD docs treatment: HARMONIZE (per Pass 6 §7.5, updated).

Brownfield ingest (Phase 0) is COMPLETE. Phase 0 → Phase 1 human approval gate is next.

**Versions bumped:** (none)

### Summary

Phase 0 gate closeout. Human approved Phase 0 → Phase 1 transition. Gate-resolution artifacts produced and committed (d1a30f1):

- Q1: 5/5 sampled pre-VSDD plans confirmed DELIVERED. Directory-wide SUPERSEDE confirmed for `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- Q2: NFR-R-D BC draft produced — 11 production read sites in 5 files. Smoking-gun at config.rs:142-149. Holdout H-NEW-MP-001 proposed. Draft ready for Phase 1 PRD formalization.
- Q4: 78-doc harmonization plan complete — 74 DELIVERED-AS-DESIGNED, 2 DELIVERED-DIVERGENT, 1 ARCHAEOLOGICAL, 0 PARTIAL/UNDELIVERED. 74 specs become BC validation inputs. v1 design imports as historical with annotated supersessions (OAuth → ADR-0006; Global config → multi-profile-auth; Project Structure → Pass 0 inventory).
- Q5: synthesis fixes committed earlier as d8ca198 (5 consistency repairs to Phase C synthesis).

DEC-001/DEC-002/DEC-003 resolved. DEC-004 added (streamlined vs full Phase 1 scope). Phase 0 COMPLETE. Phase 1 entry pending DEC-004 human decision.
