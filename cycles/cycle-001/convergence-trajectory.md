**Trajectory:** 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4→4→1→0→1→0 — **CONVERGED** (Pass 13, 2026-05-07)

### Pass 1 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 14 (2C/5H/5M/2L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

Pass 1: 2 CRITICAL mis-anchorings (S-3.01 file, S-1.06 holdout claim). 5 HIGH (holdout coverage gaps, NFR-S-A orphan). 5 MEDIUM (BC mis-anchor S-3.04, frontmatter schema, refresh_oauth_token signature, sizing). All FIXED. New story S-3.09 added. STORY-INDEX v1.4.0, 31 stories total.

---

### Pass 2 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 5 (0C/0H/3M/1L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

Severity dropping (CRITICAL/HIGH→MED/LOW). Trajectory 14→5. P1 fixes 7/10 verified clean; 1/10 partial (sibling-text propagation gap S-2.02→H-021). 3 BC mis-anchorings in Pre-existing Test Coverage appendix (P1-introduced content). Trend converging.

---

### Pass 3 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 5 (0C/1H/3M/1L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

P2 fix gap caught (GAP-H-006 BC residue). HIGH WAVE-PLAN drift caught (Wave 1/2/3 still TBD placeholders post-burst). S-2.07 H-020 false attribution to S-1.06. S-1.06 Out of Scope missing H-008. S-2.06 AC-005 path-dependence resolved with concrete invocation. Trajectory 14→5→5.

### Pass 4 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 5 (0C/0H/4M/1L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

WAVE-PLAN ↔ STORY-INDEX sibling-propagation pattern recurs (P-001/002/003). Pass 1 fix to S-3.04 BC anchors didn't propagate to WAVE-PLAN. Pass 4 fixes WAVE-PLAN to match STORY-INDEX. S-2.05 NFR-O-R added to STORY-INDEX (WAVE-PLAN was correct). Wave 3 efforts reconciled (S-3.02 small, S-3.03 medium, S-3.07 small) in WAVE-PLAN. S-0.01 Test Plan decisively chooses Option (1) constructor extension. S-0.02 conditional language resolved: total/start_at are pub fields, not methods. DRIFT-003 added (sibling-sweep process gap). Trajectory 14→5→5→5.

---

### Pass 5 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 4 (0C/1H/1M/2L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

P4 fixes 5/5 verified clean. New pattern: AC-trace target BCs not in bc_anchors (S-3.07 — surfaces semantic mis-anchor + frontmatter coherence issue). S-3.05 missing Holdout Strategy section. S-1.06 dep propagation gap. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4.

---

### Pass 6 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 5 (1C/1H/2M/1L) — REGRESSION
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

CRITICAL discovery: BC-6.4.* dangling in STORY-INDEX (since corpus inception, propagated by P5 fix). Fresh-context BC catalog walk surfaced this. Replaced 7 sites with BC-6.1.004/BC-6.1.005. BC-2.1.001 mis-anchor removed from S-3.07 (anti-loop guard now NFR-R-F-anchored only). 4 P5 propagation gaps caught + fixed. DRIFT-004 added.

---

### Pass 7 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 4 (0C/1H/2M/1L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

P6 fixes 5/5 verified clean. DRIFT-004 deep BC sweep CLEAN. New finding classes: risk_anchors semantic mis-anchor (R-M5→R-M2 in S-3.04); fabricated BC anchor (S-2.05 BC-6.1.001 stretched paraphrase, removed); STORY-INDEX:108 BC-2.1.013 propagation gap (DRIFT-003 recurrence); S-1.06 ADR-0013 forward-ref annotated. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4→5→4.

**Findings:** 4 (0C/1H/1M/2L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

HIGH: H-009 row mis-anchor in Pre-existing Test Coverage (sibling-sweep miss from Pass 2 fix family; BC-X.8.001→BC-2.3.035). MEDIUM: S-1.05 NFR-S-B→NFR-S-E (S-0.05 owns NFR-S-B; S-1.05 owns CI/CD config NFR-S-E). LOW: H-NEW-AUTH-002 absence annotated in holdout-scenarios.md frontmatter; H-NEW-MP-001 dual-format documented in preamble. Proactive appendix audit performed — 6 additional BC mismatches corrected: H-010/H-011/H-012/H-015/H-018/H-024/H-026 + Gap Register sync. DRIFT-003 recurrence: sibling-sweep miss at H-009. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4.

---

### Pass 9 (2026-05-06)

**Findings:** 4 (0C/2H/2M/0L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

All 4 findings = DRIFT-003 sibling-propagation recurrences. P8 NFR-S-B→S-E body propagation miss (HIGH): S-1.05 body + AC-001 + AC-005 + STORY-INDEX:88 exit gate updated. S-2.01 frontmatter 10 BCs vs index 4 (HIGH): BC-2.1.013 removed (single-owner with S-2.02); STORY-INDEX:107 reconciled to 9 BCs. S-0.07 fabricated BC paraphrase (MED): bc_anchors cleared, AC-001 trace retargeted to SD-002 resolution. WAVE-PLAN drift (MED): S-1.07 +BC-X.1.005, S-1.08 +BC-1.4.025, S-2.07 effort small→medium. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4→4.

---

### Pass 10 (2026-05-07)

**Findings:** 1 (0C/0H/1M/0L)
**Convergence counter:** 0 of 3

Strong convergence signal: trajectory dropped 4→1. Pass 9 fixes 7/7 verified clean. Single finding: S-1.08 depends_on drift (DRIFT-003 recurrence; over-declared mirror of S-1.06; `depends_on: [S-0.05]` removed from S-1.08 frontmatter + WAVE-PLAN synced). Pass 11 target: CLEAN-PASS.

---

### Pass 11 (2026-05-07)

**Findings:** 0 — CLEAN-PASS
**Convergence counter:** 1 of 3

FIRST CLEAN-PASS after 10 SUBSTANTIVE passes. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4→4→1→0. P10 fix verified across 4 surfaces (S-1.08 frontmatter, body, WAVE-PLAN, STORY-INDEX). 2 carry-forward observations (JiaClient cosmetic typo, story-id manifest gap) tagged but below threshold.

---

### Pass 12 (2026-05-07)

**Findings:** 1 (0C/0H/1M/0L) — CLEAN-PASS (sub-threshold)
**Convergence counter:** 2 of 3 (strict-binary: CLEAN-PASS; 1 finding < 3-finding threshold)

Single finding ADV-P2-S12-001 (MEDIUM): S-1.08 body line 274 "Depends on S-0.05" — DRIFT-003 recurrence (body propagation miss from P10 partial-fix). RESOLVED this burst by story-writer. Trajectory 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4→4→1→0→1. 1 more consecutive CLEAN-PASS needed for 3/3 convergence.

---

### Pass 13 (2026-05-07)

**Findings:** 0 — CLEAN-PASS — FULL CONVERGENCE
**Convergence counter:** 3 of 3

CONVERGED. 0 substantive findings. OBS-13-1 RESOLVED (JiaClient typo global sweep; S-0.05:62/206, S-1.06:165 — 0 remaining). OBS-13-2 RESOLVED (Story Manifest table added to STORY-INDEX v1.4.1, 31 rows; version bumped to 1.4.1→1.4.2 after CV2-002 fix). ADV-P2-S12-001 body fix verified not regressed. 8 lens axes all clean. Final trajectory: 14→5→5→5→4→5→4→4→4→1→0→1→0.

**Phase 2-adv: 3/3 FULL CONVERGENCE achieved 2026-05-07.**

## Phase 3-adv — PR #357 Copilot Review (chore/release-gate-jr-base-url-335)

### PR #357 Trajectory Summary

| Round | Date | Findings | Delta | Fix SHA | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| R1 | 2026-05-12 | 3 | — | 144aaff | CRITICAL: Config::base_url() ungated; MEDIUM: missing regression tests; LOW: CLAUDE.md inaccuracy. All 3 Perplexity-validated before acting. Two-site gating completed (config.rs + client.rs). 4 test_335_* tests added. CLAUDE.md updated. |

**Trajectory shorthand:** `3→0` — **CONVERGED** at R2 / **MERGED** @ d208a6d (2026-05-12T03:03:12Z)

**Initial commit:** cb3e8a3 (8-line diff: src/api/client.rs + CLAUDE.md)
**Fix commit:** 144aaff (added Config::base_url() gate + tests/base_url_release_gate.rs + CLAUDE.md two-site doc)

### Comparative Analysis: PR #357 vs PR #356

| Metric | PR #356 (sanitize-errors-334) | PR #357 (release-gate-jr-base-url-335) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Rounds | 19 | 2 |
| Findings total | 36 | 3 |
| Trajectory | 4→1→2→2→3→2→3→2→2→1→1→2→1→1→2→3→1→1→0 | 3→0 |
| Fix commits | Multiple (51e2807, d061b14, 274961c, fe25e22, ...etc.) | 1 (144aaff) |
| Doc-fallout cluster? | Yes (R14→R18: 7 findings from Unicode C1 change) | No — doc-fallout lesson applied (CLAUDE.md updated in same fix commit) |
| Order of magnitude difference | — | ~10x fewer rounds |

**Root cause of order-of-magnitude difference:**
1. **Tight scope:** PR #357 was an 8-line diff with one security pattern, vs PR #356's broad escape-encoding behavioral change.
2. **Pre-validation done before R1:** Perplexity validated the #[cfg(debug_assertions)] approach (retroactively, but before R1 was triaged). No round was wasted on an invalid fix approach.
3. **R1 caught the critical gap immediately:** The CRITICAL finding (Config::base_url() ungated) was surfaced and fixed in a single tight commit covering all three issues atomically.
4. **Doc-fallout lesson applied:** commit 144aaff updated CLAUDE.md in the SAME commit as the code fix — preventing the 4-round doc-fallout cluster pattern seen in PR #356 R14-R18.
5. **No regression accumulation:** PR #356 had regressions at R5, R8, R11, R14, R17 (5 regression rounds); PR #357 had zero — the fix was correct on the first attempt once the surface area was complete.

**Lesson validated:** Pre-fixing the doc-fallout class (updating docs atomically with behavior) eliminates an entire category of subsequent review rounds. PR #357 is the first confirmed successful application of the doc-fallout lesson codified during PR #356 R19.
