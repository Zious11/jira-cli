## Pending Decisions

| ID | Decision | Options | Due | Decided By |
|----|----------|---------|-----|------------|
| DEC-004 | Phase 1 spec crystallization scope: full pipeline (market intel → L2 → L3 → architecture → DTU → CI/CD → adversarial) vs streamlined brownfield-Phase-1 (skip market intel for shipped product; skip DTU since no third-party clone need; harmonize existing ADRs/specs into L2/L3). Recommended: streamlined. | full / streamlined (recommended) | Phase 1 start | orchestrator + human |

## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| DEC-001 | Pre-VSDD docs treatment: RESOLVED — HARMONIZE per Q4 (74 specs become BC validation inputs; 1 archaeological excluded; 2 divergent need reconciliation; v1 design imported as historical with annotated supersessions on 3 sections; 75 plans SUPERSEDE) | Q4 harmonization plan confirmed 74 DELIVERED-AS-DESIGNED, 0 PARTIAL/UNDELIVERED. Plans dir cleanly SUPERSEDE. | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | human |
| DEC-002 | Pre-VSDD docs at Phase 0→1 gate: RESOLVED — see DEC-001 | Consolidated into DEC-001 outcome | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | human |
| DEC-003 | 5 MUST-FIX bugs treatment: PARTIALLY RESOLVED — NFR-R-D has draft BC (11 read sites in 5 files; holdout H-NEW-MP-001 proposed). 4 P0 bugs route to Phase 3 (decompose-stories) for fix-in-phase-3 treatment. | Draft BC ready for Phase 1 PRD formalization. | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | orchestrator + human |
