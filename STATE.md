## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| DEC-001 | Pre-VSDD docs treatment: RESOLVED — HARMONIZE per Q4 (74 specs become BC validation inputs; 1 archaeological excluded; 2 divergent need reconciliation; v1 design imported as historical with annotated supersessions on 3 sections; 75 plans SUPERSEDE) | Q4 harmonization plan confirmed 74 DELIVERED-AS-DESIGNED, 0 PARTIAL/UNDELIVERED. Plans dir cleanly SUPERSEDE. | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | human |
| DEC-002 | Pre-VSDD docs at Phase 0→1 gate: RESOLVED — see DEC-001 | Consolidated into DEC-001 outcome | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | human |
| DEC-003 | 5 MUST-FIX bugs treatment: PARTIALLY RESOLVED — NFR-R-D has draft BC (14 read sites in 6 files; holdout H-NEW-MP-001 proposed). 4 P0 bugs route to Phase 3 (decompose-stories) for fix-in-phase-3 treatment. | Draft BC ready for Phase 1 PRD formalization. | Phase 0 | 2026-05-04 | orchestrator + human |
| DEC-005 | Phase 1d Adversarial Spec Review converged 3/3 at Pass 28 | 28 total passes (25 SUBSTANTIVE + 3 consecutive CLEAN-PASS). 80+ findings addressed across rotating lens axes. Trajectory shows healthy descent. Spec corpus locked: 541 BCs, 41 NFRs, 48 holdouts, 26 risks, 12 ADRs, 3 SD. | Phase 1d | 2026-05-04 | orchestrator + adversary |
| DEC-006 | SD-001 = Option C — PKCE deferred with ADR-0013 | Atlassian Cloud doesn't publicly support PKCE; Options A/B technically infeasible. Threat model documented with mitigations. Reactivation trigger set. | Phase 1→2 gate | 2026-05-04 | human + perplexity research |
| DEC-007 | SD-002 = Option A (`#[cfg(test)]`) at gate; canonized to Option B-revised (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`) during S-0.05 implementation (2026-05-07) | ~151 subprocess tests use `cargo_bin("jr").env("JR_AUTH_HEADER", ...)` — subprocess binary has no cfg(test); `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` achieves identical release-binary security. See SD-002 canonization. | Phase 1→2 gate / S-0.05 | 2026-05-04 / 2026-05-07 | human + perplexity research / implementer |
| DEC-008 | SD-003 = Option B — header-only `--verbose` default + opt-in `--verbose-bodies` with PII warning | Strongest default security; mitigates AI-agent context capture (EDPB Apr 2025). Breaking change for v0.6. | Phase 1→2 gate | 2026-05-04 | human + perplexity research |
| DEC-009 | Phase 1 → Phase 2 gate APPROVED | All pending decisions resolved (DEC-006/007/008). Spec corpus locked: 541 BCs / 41 NFRs / 48 holdouts / 28 risks / 13 ADRs / 3 SDs. | Phase 1→2 gate | 2026-05-04 | human |

## Drift Items

<!-- Populated during Phase 0 codebase ingestion. -->

| ID | Area | Description | Severity | Status |
|----|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| DRIFT-001 | Pass 21+ propagation (recurring) | Count/chain-length fixes require downstream grep sweep. P21 missed H-044+L2; P23-001 reaffirms; ADV-P24-001 is third recurrence. Codify as S-7.01. Every count/chain-length change must trigger grep sweep. | MEDIUM | process-gap recurring (S-3.06 codification story in Wave 3) |
| DRIFT-002 | NFR-S-B holdout gap | **RESOLVED** — SD-002 = Option A; NFR-S-B holdout now definable (S-1.05). | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| DRIFT-003 | STORY-INDEX → WAVE-PLAN sibling propagation gap | Recurred P1/P2/P3/P4/P7/P8/P9/P12 of Phase 2-adv. Structural pattern. S-3.06 scope should include WAVE-PLAN↔STORY-INDEX↔frontmatter triple-sync verification. | MEDIUM | process-gap (S-3.06 scope expansion needed) |
| DRIFT-004 | STORY-INDEX BC IDs not validated against canonical bc-N-*.md | P6 surfaced BC-6.4.* dangling (since corpus inception). Fix authors must open canonical BC file. | HIGH | process-gap (verify every BC ID against canonical bc-N-*.md) |
| ADV-P2-S12-001 | S-1.08 body line 274 stale dep | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — body line 274 updated to "No Wave 0 dependencies…" | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| OBS-13-1 | JiaClient cosmetic typo | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — global sweep; 0 remaining matches | LOW | **RESOLVED** |
| OBS-13-2 | Story manifest tooling gap | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — Story Manifest table (31 rows) added to STORY-INDEX v1.4.1 | LOW | **RESOLVED** |
| CV2-001 | STATE.md stale story count | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — STATE.md line 54 fixed (30→31, W3:8→W3:9) | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| CV2-002 | STORY-INDEX S-2.04 BC column incomplete | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — S-2.04 BC column completed (3→7 BCs); v1.4.2 | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| CV2-003 | SD-003 holdout gap | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — H-NEW-VERBOSE-001/002 registered; WAVE-PLAN updated (v1.1.1); S-0.06 cross-link added | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| R1-001 | JiraClient::new_for_test_with_instance_url ergonomics | DEFERRED — 2026-05-07 — takes (base_url, instance_url) where one concept might suffice. Test-infra only; no correctness impact. Target: bundle into next workflow.rs/client.rs touch (likely Wave 3 cleanup or absorbed by S-0.05/0.06). | LOW | DEFERRED |
| R1-002 | Stale doc comment in workflow.rs handle_open | DEFERRED — 2026-05-07 — referenced "base URL" pre-fix; one-line text fix. Target: assign to next implementer touching workflow.rs. | LOW | DEFERRED |
| S-0.03-S1 | Missing integration test for effective_wid fallback path at list.rs:464-470 | DEFERRED — 2026-05-07 — raw_wid empty → fallback_wid lookup branch has no integration test. Logic correct; coverage gap. Target: bundle into next list.rs/CMDB-related touch (likely Wave 2 issue-list test suite expansion S-2.01/S-2.02) OR add as a follow-up small story in the CMDB epic. | LOW | DEFERRED |
| S-0.05-DEV | SD-002 doc-vs-code drift (gate canonization) | **RESOLVED** — 2026-05-07 — SD-002 canonized to Option B-revised (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`) during S-0.05 implementation. 151-subprocess-test compatibility preserved. Threat model mitigation equivalent to Option A original. Doc updates: SD-002.md (Resolution, Options, Decision Log, version 1.0.1) + S-0.05 (Context, BC, ACs, Implementation Notes, Compliance Rules) + S-0.07 (Context, AC-004, holdout spec SD field) + STATE.md (DEC-007, Current Phase Steps). | MEDIUM | **RESOLVED** |
| S-0.05-F1 | Cosmetic typo "JiaClient" → "JiraClient" in test doc comment line 153 of tests/auth_header_release_gate.rs | DEFERRED — 2026-05-07 — Target: bundle into next test-doc cleanup or absorbed by S-0.07 since that story authors related holdouts. | LOW | DEFERRED |
| S-0.05-F2 | Stale doc comment in renamed test (likely fixed in clippy-fix commit c82832c) | TO_VERIFY — 2026-05-07 — Verify in next read; close if resolved. | LOW | TO_VERIFY |
| S-0.05-F3 | load_auth_from_keychain could comment that _refresh token is intentionally discarded (matches pre-existing behavior) | DEFERRED — 2026-05-07 — Cosmetic doc improvement. Target: next src/api/client.rs touch. | LOW | DEFERRED |
